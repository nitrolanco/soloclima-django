# Soloclima: A Django MongoDB Misadventure üö®ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## üî• Project Overview: What Were We Thinking?

Welcome to Soloclima, a prime example of how NOT to build a web application. This project is a spectacular demonstration of architectural anti-patterns, where we've taken Django - a robust web framework - and brutally misused it to create a half-baked, REST-like MongoDB interface.

### üö® Warning: Technical Malpractice Ahead

**Disclaimer**: This project is a cautionary tale of what happens when you ignore best practices and decide to reinvent the wheel... poorly.

## ü§î The Questionable Concept

We've created a Django project that:

- Completely ignores Django's ORM (Because who needs robust database abstraction, right?)
- Uses MongoDB directly through `pymongo`
- Manually handles what Django would do automatically
- Breaks every convention of both Django and RESTful design

## üõ† Technologies Abused

- **Django**: Used as a glorified template renderer
- **MongoDB**: Treated like a JSON dumping ground
- **Python**: Suffering through our terrible architectural decisions

## üí• Why This is a Terrible Idea

### 1. Bypassing Django's ORM

- Lost automatic database migrations
- No built-in query optimization
- Manual everything = maximum developer pain

### 2. REST-Like? More Like REST-In-Peace

- No proper API framework
- Custom, inefficient data fetching
- Zero API documentation
- Completely manual routing and serialization

### 3. Performance Nightmare

- Direct MongoDB queries without caching
- No connection pooling
- Reinventing every wheel Django provides out-of-the-box

## ü§Ø Code Smell Highlights

```python
# Behold, the pinnacle of inefficiency!
def product_list(request):
    # Manually fetching data like a caveman
    db = get_mongo_database()
    products_collection = db['products']
    products = list(products_collection.find())
```
